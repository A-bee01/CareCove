## Problem
In 2024, despite the widespread belief that the world has become technologically advanced, countless people in third-world countries 
continue to face life-threatening challenges. In Nigeria, we still witness tragic reports of deaths caused by preventable diseases 
like cholera due to a lack of clean water. Many affected communities receive little to no assistance. 
The northern region of Nigeria has also endured relentless violence from Boko Haram insurgencies, leaving countless families without shelter, 
forced to live in constant fear. Heartbreaking stories of abandoned children and desperate parents struggling to provide for their families are all too common.

It is devastating to watch children—who should be the future drivers of societal growth—cry in despair, 
while parents are left in a state of helplessness and disappointment. Nigeria is just one example, 
but similar challenges are faced by other African countries. From lack of basic necessities like clean water and shelter to the ongoing toll of conflict, 
the situation across the continent paints a grim picture. These are not just isolated incidents but systemic issues that require 
urgent attention and sustainable solutions
